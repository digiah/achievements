# Achievements

Summary

Develop a growing pool of "exercises" and "activities" of varied complexity that allow members to explore the various tools that describe, shape and navigate the landscapes of the digital humanities. Members that complete these achievements get a badge that is registered with their DAHI profile and displayed as a part of I/O.

Achievements should come from the different corners of the DAHI community, reflecting the academic and creative diversity at our disposal, promoting cross-pollination of tactics and techniques.

The goal is to find the means to make behavioral adjustments to the community through tasks/experiments that are manageable and relevant, in contrast to larger-scale, longer-term projects.

Some possibilities:

* Turn a spreadsheet into a Google database
* Turn a spreadsheet into CSV and import into (forthcoming) DAHI I/O module
* Create a TiddlyWiki that reflects a facet of research
